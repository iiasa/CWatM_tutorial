WATCH+WFDEI
-----------

Daily-resolution observed climate data on a global (land only) 0.5°x0.5° lat-lon grid, 
based on the reanalysis data set ERA-Interim and using the bias target GPCC. 
The data set covers the period 1901-2012, where the data for 1901-1978 are taken from WFD, and from 1979 onwards from WFDEI.GPCC

Variables: 
tasmax: Max Temperature [K]
tas: Avg. Temperature [K]
tasmin: Max Temperature [K]
rlds: Long wave radiation flux downward [W m-2]
